**Brief Description:**

https://volunteer-me.netlify.app/login

Volunteer Me is a full-stack application that matches people in need with volunteers willing to help. Users can make posts requesting help for a wide variety of tasks from getting help picking up their groceries to assembling their furniture. Each user requesting help has the option to pledge a certain dollar amount to charity if the task gets completed. There is a volunteer leaderboard that displays how much each volunteer has raised for charity.

**Why I built it:**

This app was inspired by a NextDoor post where users within my community offered help to those quarantining due to Covid, purely off of goodwill. I wanted to create a charity-focused alternative to popular gig economy apps such as TaskRabbit and Postmates.
   

**About the tech stack:**

Volunteer.Me is built using React, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Database for storing tasks and user details, MapBox APIs for interactive map, geocoding, and address autocomplete, and Paypal API to process donations. 


**Features:**
1) User Authentication
2) Public and Private Routes
3) CRUD functions for tasks
4) Interactive Map with markers
5) Address Autocomplete
6) Sort Tasks by Date Posted, Volunteer Date, or Category
7) Real-Time Chat 
8) Volunteer Leaderboard
9) Payment processing w/ PayPal
